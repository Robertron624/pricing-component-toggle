## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - JS bundler
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

I learned a little bit of CSS animations for the toggle switcher, and handling de window events for adding the switcher functionality with the keyboard.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning more about animations and transitions in CSS, and also I want to learn to use CSS in the cases where I used JS in this project, like the toggle switcher.
